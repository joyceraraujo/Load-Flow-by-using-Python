# Load-Flow-by-using-Python

This project aims to solve the problem of load flow by using Python and its package for scientific computing, Numpy. 
Firstly,  the native fonction fsolve has been used to solve the system of nonlinear equations that represents
the load flow equations.
After checking the results obtained by fsolve, the goal is to implement the Newton Method to solve the system of 
nonlinear equations.
